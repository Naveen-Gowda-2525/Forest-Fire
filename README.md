# Forest-Fire
The objective was to predict the burned area of a forest fire. The data was cleaned using pre 
processing techniques such as label encoding, outlier detection and duplicates removal.The visualizations
were drawn with the help of pandas profilling.A classification model was built by splitting the data set into test and 
train data set and implementing Neural Networks with the best parameters obtained by hyperaparameter optimization.
The train and test accuracy were found to be 100 % and 99% respectfully.
